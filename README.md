# KMP-composable-architecture

Kotlin Multiplatform implementation of [Point-Free's The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)
loosely based on [Toggl's Android implementation](https://github.com/toggl/komposable-architecture) but with several fundamental changes and improvements.

## Version information:
| Version       | Kotlin | Coroutines |
|---------------|--------|:----------:|
| _latest_      | 1.9.10 |   1.7.3    |

## Differences from Toggl's komposable-architecture
* Kotlin Multiplatform support for use in KMM projects
* The `Effect` interface is based on `Flows` instead of suspending functions allowing for long running Effects
* Addition of explicit cancellation of Effects
* Addition of `ScopedActions` for providing scopes for long running effects (for example ViewModelScopes in Android)
* Removal of `Subscriptions`
* An improved `MutableStateFlowStore` send function with support for buffering and batching actions.
* Minor name changes to more closely match the original Swift implementation
